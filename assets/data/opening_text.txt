Between 1850 and 1950, the world saw a significant increase in CO2 emissions due to the Industrial Revolution and rapid industrialization. As societies embraced technological advancements, the burning of fossil fuels released vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, leading to a buildup of greenhouse gases and contributing to global warming. Despite the challenges posed by this historical trend, we have also made incredible progress in understanding and addressing climate change. Through innovative solutions, international cooperation, and collective action, we can mitigate the impacts of CO2 emissions and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
